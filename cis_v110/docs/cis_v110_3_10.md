## Description

It is recommended to setup an Event Rule and Notification that gets triggered when route tables are created, updated or deleted. Event Rules are compartment scoped and will detect events in child compartments, it is recommended to create the Event rule at the root compartment level.

## Remediation

### From Console

1. Go to the [Events Service page](https://console.us-ashburn1.oraclecloud.com/events/rules)
2. Select the compartment that should host the rule.
3. Click `Create Rule`.
4. Provide a `Display Name` and `Description`.
5. Create a `Rule Condition` by selecting `Networking` in the `Service Name` Drop-down and selecting `Route Table – Change Compartment`, `Route Table – Create`, `Route Table - Delete` and `Route Table – Update`.
6. In the `Actions` section select `Notifications` as `Action Type`.
7. Select the `Compartment` that hosts the `Topic` to be used.
8. Select the `Topic` to be used.
9. Optionally add `Tags` to the `Rule`.
10. Click `Create Rule`.

### From Command Line

1. Find the `topic-id` of the `Event Rule` which should be used for sending Notifications by using the `topic name` and `Compartment OCID`.

```bash
oci ons topic list --compartment-id=<compartment OCID> --all --query "data [?name=='<topic_name>']".{"name:name,topic_id:\"topic-id\""} --output table
```

2. Create a JSON file to be used when creating the `Event Rule`. Replace `topic id`, `display name`, `description` and `compartment OCID`.

```bash
{
  "actions":
  {
    "actions": [
    {
      "actionType": "ONS",
      "isEnabled": true,
      "topicId": "<topic id>"
    }]
  },
  "condition":
"{\"eventType\":[\"com.oraclecloud.virtualnetwork.changeroutetablecompartment\",\"com.oraclecloud.virtualnetwork.createroutetable\",\"com.oraclecloud.virtualnetwork.deleteroutetable\",\"com.oraclecloud.virtualnetwork.updateroutetable\"],\"data\":{}}",
  "displayName": "<display name>",
  "description": "<description>",
  "isEnabled": true,
  "compartmentId": "compartment OCID"
}
```

3. Create the actual `event rule`.

```bash
oci events rule create --from-json file://event_rule.json
```

4. Note in the JSON returned that it lists the parameters specified in the JSON file provided and that there is an `OCID` provided for the `Event Rule`.
