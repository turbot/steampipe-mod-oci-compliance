## Description

Oracle Object Storage buckets support encryption with a Customer Managed Key (CMK). By default, Object Storage buckets are encrypted with an Oracle managed key. Encryption of storage buckets provides an additional level of security on your data. Management of encryption keys is critical to protecting and accessing protected data. Some customers want to identify storage buckets encrypted Oracle-managed keys in order to apply their own key lifecycle management to the bucket.
