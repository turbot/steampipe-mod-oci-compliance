## Description

Auth tokens are authentication tokens generated by Oracle. You use auth tokens to authenticate with APIs that do not support the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure signature-based authentication. If the service requires an auth token, the service-specific documentation instructs you to generate one and how to use it.
