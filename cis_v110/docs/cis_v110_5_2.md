## Description

When you create a cloud resource such as an instance, block volume, or cloud network, you must specify to which compartment you want the resource to belong. Placing resources in the root compartment makes it difficult to organize and isolate those resources.

## Remediation

### From Console

1. Login to [OCI Console](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/).
2. Click in the search bar, top of the screen.
3. Type `Advance Resource Query` and hit enter.
4. Click the `Advanced Resource Query` button in the upper right of the screen.
5. Enter the following query into the query box:

```bash
query
  VCN, instance, volume, filesystem, bucket, autonomousdatabase, database, dbsystem resources
  where compartmentId = '<tenancy-id>'
```

6. For each item in the returned results, click the item name.
7. Then select `Move Resource` or `More Actions` then `Move Resource`.
8. Select a `compartment` that is not the `root compartment` in `CHOOSE NEW COMPARTMENT`.
9. Click `Move Resource`.

### From Command Line

1. Execute the following command:

```bash
oci search resource structured-search --query-text "query
  VCN, instance, volume, filesystem, bucket, autonomousdatabase, database, dbsystem resources
  where compartmentId = '<tenancy-id>'"
```

2. For each bucket item execute the below command:

```bash
oci os bucket update --bucket-name <bucket-name> --compartment-id <not root compartment-id>
```

3. For other resources use the change-compartment command for the resource type:

```bash
oci <service-command> <resource-command> change-compartment --<item-id> <item-id> --compartment-id <not root compartment-id>

Example for an Autonomous Database:

oci db autonomous-database change-compartment --autonomous-database-id <autonmous-database-id> --compartment-id <not root compartment-id>
```
