## Description

VCN flow logs record details about traffic that has been accepted or rejected based on the security list rule.

## Remediation

### From Console

First, if a log group for holding these logs has not already been created, create a log group by the following steps:

1. Go to the [Log Groups page](https://console.us-ashburn1.oraclecloud.com/logging/log-groups).
2. Click the `Create Log Groups` button in the middle of the screen.
3. Select the relevant compartment to place these logs.
4. Type a name for the log group in the `Name` box.
5. Add an optional description in the `Description` box.
6. Click the `Create` button in the lower left hand corner.

Second, enable VCN flow logging for your subnet(s) by the following steps:

1. Go to the [Logs page](https://console.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/logging/logs).
2. Click the `Enable Service Log` button in the middle of the screen.
3. Select the relevant resource compartment.
4. Select `Virtual Cloud Networks (subnets)` from the Service drop down menu.
5. Select the relevant resource from the resource drop down menu.
6. Select `Flow Logs (all records)` from the `Log Category` drop down menu.
7. Type a name for your flow logs in the Log `Name` drop down menu.
8. Click the `Enable Log` button in the lower left hand corner.

### From Command Line

1. Set the variable C to the OCID of the compartment

```bash
export C=<Compartment OCID>
```

2. Create a `log group`:

```bash
oci logging log-group create --compartment-id $C \ 
--display-name "<DisplayName>" \
--description "<Description>"
```

The output of the command gives you a work request id. You can query the work request to see the status of the job by issuing the following command:

```bash
oci logging work-request get --work-request-id <output from command above>
```

Look for the status filed to be SUCCEEDED.

3. Get the `Log group ID`, needed for creating the Log:

```bash
oci logging log-group list --compartment-id $C \
--query 'data[?contains("display-name", `'"<DisplayName>"'`)].id|join(`\n`, @)' \
--raw-output
```

4. Create a JSON file called config.json with the following content:

```bash
{
  "compartment-id":"ocid1.compartment.oc1.......",
  "source": {
    "resource": "ocid1.subnet.oc1.iad.......",
    "service": "flowlogs",
    "source-type": "OCISERVICE",
    "category": "all"
  }
}
```

The compartment-id is the `Compartment OCID` of where the subnet resource is present. The resource value is the `OCID` of subnet for which flowlogs is enabled.

5. Create the `Service Log`:

```bash
oci logging log create --log-group-id <value from step 3.> \
--display-name "<DisplayName>" \
--log-type SERVICE --is-enabled TRUE \
--configuration file://config.json
```

The output of the command gives you a work request id. You can query the work request to see that status of the job by issuing the following command:

```bash
oci logging work-request get --work-request-id <output from command above>
```

Look for the status filed to be SUCCEEDED.
