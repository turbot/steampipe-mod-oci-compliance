## Description

When you sign up for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, Oracle creates your tenancy, which is the root compartment that holds all your cloud resources. You then create additional compartments within the tenancy (root compartment) and corresponding policies to control access to the resources in each compartment.

Compartments allow you to organize and control access to your cloud resources. A compartment is a collection of related resources (such as instances, databases, virtual cloud networks, block volumes) that can be accessed only by certain groups that have been given permission by an administrator.
