## Description

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure File Storage service (FSS) provides a durable, scalable, secure, enterprise-grade network file system. By default, the Oracle service manages the keys that encrypt FSS file systems. FSS file systems can also be encrypted using a customer managed key.

## Remediation

### From Console

1. Login to [OCI Console](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/).
2. Click in the search bar, top of the screen.
3. Type `Advanced Resource Query` and click enter.
4. Click the `Advanced Resource Query` button in the upper right of the screen.
5. Enter the following query in the query box:

```bash
query filesystem resources
```

6. For each file storage system returned click on the link under `Display name`
7. Ensure `Encryption Key` does not say `Oracle-managed key`
8. Repeat for other subscribed regions
9. For each File Storage System in the returned results, click the File System Storage
10. Click `Edit` next to `Encryption Key`
11. Select `Encrypt using customer-managed keys`
12. Select the ` Vault Compartment` and `Vault`
13. Select the `Master Encryption Key Compartment` and `Master Encryption key`
14. Click `Save Changes`

### From Command Line

1. Execute the following command:

```bash
for region in `oci iam region list | jq -r '.data[] | .name'`; 
do
for fssid in `oci search resource structured-search --region $region - -query-text "query filesystem resources" 2>/dev/null | jq -r '.data.items[] | .identifier'`
  do
  output=`oci fs file-system get --file-system-id $fssid --region
  $region 2>/dev/null | jq -r '.data | select(."kms-key-id" == "").id'` 
  if [ ! -z "$output" ]; then echo $output; fi
  done
done
```

2. Ensure query returns no results
3. For each `File Storage System` identified get its OCID. Execute the following command:

```bash
oci bv volume-kms-key update –volume-id <volume OCID> --kms-key-id <kms key OCID>
```
