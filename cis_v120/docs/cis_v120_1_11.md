## Description

Tenancy administrator users have full access to the organization's OCI tenancy. API keys associated with user accounts are used for invoking the OCI APIs via custom programs or clients like CLI/SDKs. The clients are typically used for performing day-to-day operations and should never require full tenancy access. Service-level administrative users with API keys should be used instead.
