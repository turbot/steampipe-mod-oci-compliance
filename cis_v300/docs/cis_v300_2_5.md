## Description

A default security list is created when a Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) is created and attached to the public subnets in the VCN. Security lists provide stateful or stateless filtering of ingress and egress network traffic to OCI resources in the VCN. It is recommended that the default security list does not allow unrestricted ingress and egress access to resources in the VCN.

Removing unfettered connectivity to OCI resource, reduces a server's exposure to unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
