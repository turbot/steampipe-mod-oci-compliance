## Description

Object Storage provides an API to enable interoperability with Amazon S3. To use this Amazon S3 Compatibility API, you need to generate the signing key required to authenticate with Amazon S3.

This special signing key is an Access Key/Secret Key pair. Oracle generates the Customer Secret key to pair with the Access Key.

It is important to rotate customer secret keys at least every 90 days, as they provide the same level of object storage access that the user they are associated with has.
