## Description

Auth tokens are authentication tokens generated by Oracle. You use auth tokens to authenticate with APIs that do not support the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure signature-based authentication. If the service requires an auth token, the service-specific documentation instructs you to generate one and how to use it.

It is important to secure and rotate an auth token every 90 days or less as it provides the same level of access to APIs that do not support the OCI signature-based authentication as the user associated to it.
