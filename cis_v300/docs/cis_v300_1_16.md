## Description

OCI IAM Local users can access OCI resources using different credentials, such as passwords or API keys. It is recommended that credentials that have been unused for 45 days or more be deactivated or removed.

Disabling or removing unnecessary OCI IAM local users will reduce the window of opportunity for credentials associated with a compromised or abandoned account to be used.

## Remediation

1. Login to OCI Console.
2. Select `Identity & Security` from the Services menu.
