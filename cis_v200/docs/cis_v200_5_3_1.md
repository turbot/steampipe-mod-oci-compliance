## Description

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure File Storage service (FSS) provides a durable, scalable, secure, enterprise-grade network file system. By default, the Oracle service manages the keys that encrypt FSS file systems. FSS file systems can also be encrypted using a customer managed key.

Encryption of FSS systems provides an additional level of security for your data. Management of encryption keys is critical to protecting and accessing protected data. Customers should identify FSS file systems that are encrypted with Oracle service managed keys in order to determine if they want to manage the keys for certain FSS file systems and then apply their own key lifecycle management to the selected FSS file systems.
