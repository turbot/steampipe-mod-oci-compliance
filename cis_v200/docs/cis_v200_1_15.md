## Description

To apply the separation of duties security principle, one can restrict service-level administrators from being able to delete resources they are managing. It means service-level administrators can only manage resources of a specific service but not delete resources for that specific service.

Example policies for global/tenant level for block volume service-administrators:

```bash
Allow group VolumeUsers to manage volumes in tenancy where request.permission!='VOLUME_DELETE'
Allow group VolumeUsers to manage volume-backups in tenancy where request.permission!='VOLUME_BACKUP_DELETE'
```

Example policies for global/tenant level for file storage system service-administrators:

```bash
Allow group FileUsers to manage file-systems in tenancy where request.permission!='FILE_SYSTEM_DELETE'
Allow group FileUsers to manage mount-targets in tenancy where request.permission!='MOUNT_TARGET_DELETE'
Allow group FileUsers to manage export-sets in tenancy where request.permission!='EXPORT_SET_DELETE'
```

Example policies for global/tenant level for object storage system service- administrators:

```bash
Allow group BucketUsers to manage objects in tenancy where request.permission!='OBJECT_DELETE'
Allow group BucketUsers to manage buckets in tenancy where request.permission!='BUCKET_DELETE'
```

## Remediation

### From Console
