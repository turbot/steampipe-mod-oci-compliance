## Description

When you create a cloud resource such as an instance, block volume, or cloud network, you must specify to which compartment you want the resource to belong. Placing resources in the root compartment makes it difficult to organize and isolate those resources.

Placing resources into a compartment will allow you to organize and have more granular access controls to your cloud resources.

```bash
oci os bucket update --bucket-name <bucket-name> --compartment-id <not rootcompartment-id>

```
