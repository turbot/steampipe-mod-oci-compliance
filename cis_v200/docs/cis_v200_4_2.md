## Description

Notifications provide a multi-channel messaging service that allow users and applications to be notified of events of interest occurring within OCI. Messages can be sent via eMail, HTTPs, PagerDuty, Slack or the OCI Function service. Some channels, such as eMail require confirmation of the subscription before it becomes active.

Creating one or more notification topics allow administrators to be notified of relevant changes made to OCI infrastructure.

### From CLI

1. Create a topic in a compartment

```bash
oci ons topic create --name <topic name> --description <topic description> -- compartment-id <compartment OCID>
```

2. Note the `OCID` of the `topic` using the `topic-id` field of the returned JSON and use it to create new subscriptions

```bash
oci ons subscription create --compartment-id <compartment OCID> --topic-id <topic OCID> --protocol <protocol> --subscription-endpoint <subscription endpoint>
```

3. The returned JSON includes the id of the `subscription`.
