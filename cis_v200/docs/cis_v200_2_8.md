## Description

Oracle Autonomous Database Shared (ADB-S) automates database tuning, security, backups, updates, and other routine management tasks traditionally performed by DBAs. ADB-S provide ingress filtering of network traffic or can be deployed within an existing Virtual Cloud Network (VCN). It is recommended that all new ADB-S databases be deployed within a VCN and that the Access Control Rules are restricted to your corporate IP Addresses or VCNs for existing ADB-S databases.

## Remediation

### From Console

1. Follow the audit procedure above.
2. For each ADB-S database in the returned results, click the ADB-S database name.
3. Click `Edit` next to `Access Control Rules`.
4. Click `+Another Rule` and add rules as required.
5. Click `Save Changes`.

### From CLI

1. Follow the audit procedure.
2. Get the json input format by executing the following command:

```bash
oci db autonomous-database update --generate-full-command-json-input
```

3. For each of the ADB-S Database identified get its details.
4. Update the `whitelistIps`, copy the `WhiteListIPs` element from the JSON returned by the above get call, edit it appropriately and use it in the following command:

```bash
oci db autonomous-database update â€“-autonomous-database-id <ABD-S OCID> -- from-json '<network endpoints JSON>'
```
