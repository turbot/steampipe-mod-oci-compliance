## Description

API keys are used by administrators, developers, services and scripts for accessing OCI APIs directly or via SDKs/OCI CLI to search, create update or delete OCI resources.

The API key is an RSA key pair. The private key is used for signing the API requests and the public key is associated with a local or synchronized user's profile.

It is important to secure and rotate an API key every 90 days or less as it provides the same level of access that a user it is associated with has.

In addition to a security engineering best practice, this is also a compliance requirement. For example, PCI-DSS Section 3.6.4 states, "Verify that key-management procedures include a defined cryptoperiod for each key type in use and define a process for key changes at the end of the defined crypto period(s)."

## Remediation
