## Description

Tenancy administrators can create more users, groups, and policies to provide other service administrators access to OCI resources.

For example, an IAM administrator will need to have access to manage resources like compartments, users, groups, dynamic-groups, policies, identity-providers, tenancy tagnamespaces, tag-definitions in the tenancy.

The policy that gives IAM-Administrators or any other group full access to 'groups' resources should not allow access to the tenancy 'Administrators' group.

The policy statements would look like -

```bash
Allow group IAMAdmins to inspect users in tenancy
Allow group IAMAdmins to use users in tenancy where target.group.name != 'Administrators'
Allow group IAMAdmins to inspect groups in tenancy
Allow group IAMAdmins to use groups in tenancy where target.group.name != 'Administrators'
```

**Note**: You must include separate statements for 'inspect' access, because the target.group.name variable is not used by the ListUsers and ListGroups operations.

These policy statements ensure that no other group can manage tenancy administrator users or the membership to the 'Administrators' group thereby gain or remove tenancy administrator access.
