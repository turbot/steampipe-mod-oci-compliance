## Description

A bucket is a logical container for storing objects. Object versioning is enabled at the bucket level and is disabled by default upon creation. Versioning directs Object Storage to automatically create an object version each time a new object is uploaded, an existing object is overwritten, or when an object is deleted. You can enable object versioning at bucket creation time or later.

Versioning object storage buckets provides for additional integrity of your data. Management of data integrity is critical to protecting and accessing protected data. Some customers want to identify object storage buckets without versioning in order to apply their own data lifecycle protection and management policy.
