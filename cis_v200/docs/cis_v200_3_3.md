## Description

The Block Volume service provides the option to enable in-transit encryption for paravirtualized volume attachments on virtual machine (VM) instances.

All the data moving between the instance and the block volume is transferred over an internal and highly secure network. If you have specific compliance requirements related to the encryption of the data while it is moving between the instance and the block volume, you should enable the in-transit encryption option.
