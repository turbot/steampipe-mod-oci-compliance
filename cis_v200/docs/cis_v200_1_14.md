## Description

OCI instances, OCI database and OCI functions can access other OCI resources either via an OCI API key associated to a user or via Instance Principal. Instance Principal authentication can be achieved by inclusion in a Dynamic Group that has an IAM policy granting it the required access or using an OCI IAM policy that has request.principal added to the where clause. Access to OCI Resources refers to making API calls to another OCI resource like Object Storage, OCI Vaults, etc.

Instance Principal reduces the risks related to hard-coded credentials. Hard-coded API keys can be shared and require rotation, which can open them up to being compromised. Compromised credentials could allow access to OCI services outside of the expected radius.
