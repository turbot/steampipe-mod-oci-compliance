## Description

A bucket is a logical container for storing objects. It is associated with a single compartment that has policies that determine what action a user can perform on a bucket and on all the objects in the bucket. It is recommended that no bucket be publicly accessible.

Removing unfettered reading of objects in a bucket reduces an organization's exposure to data loss.
