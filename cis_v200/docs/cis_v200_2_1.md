## Description

Security lists provide stateful or stateless filtering of ingress/egress network traffic to OCI resources on a subnet level. It is recommended that no security group allows unrestricted ingress access to port 22.

Removing unfettered connectivity to remote console services, such as Secure Shell (SSH), reduces a server's exposure to risk.

## Remediation

### From Console

1. Follow the audit procedure above.
2. For each security list in the returned results, click the security list name.
3. Either edit the `ingress rule` to be more restrictive, delete the `ingress rule` or click on the VCN and terminate the `security list` as appropriate.

### From CLI

1. Follow the audit procedure.
2. For each of the `security lists` identified, execute the following command:

```bash
oci network security-list get --security-list-id <security list id>
```

3. Then either:

  - Update the security list by copying the ingress-security-rules element from the JSON returned by the above command, edit it appropriately and use it in the following command:

```bash
oci network security-list update --security-list-id <security-list-id> -- ingress-security-rules '<ingress security rules JSON>'
```

or

- Delete the security list

```bash
oci network security-list delete --security-list-id <security list id>
```
