## Description

A default security list is created when a Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) is created. Security lists provide stateful filtering of ingress and egress network traffic to OCI resources. It is recommended no security list allows unrestricted ingress access to resources such as Secure Shell (SSH) via port 22.

## Remediation

6. Either Edit the Security rule to restrict the source and/or port range or delete the rule.
